Project Reunion is primarily written in C++.  It will adhere to the "CPP Core Guidelines" at https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines.  Although it is not anticipated that we will require extensions or modifications to these guidelines, we may create a process for such extensions or modifications in the future.  

If new languages become common, we will describe the coding guidelines for such languages here.
