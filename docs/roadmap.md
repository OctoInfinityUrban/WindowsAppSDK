# Windows App SDK Roadmap
This roadmap frames how the Windows Development Platform team will deliver the Windows App SDK (WinAppSDK) and various technologies contained within, focused on the year ahead. It is intended to be the best entry point to conceptualize what's happening in the WinAppSDK, so you can form plans/strategies around this technology.
Details of this roadmap may change, and when they do, we'll strive to update the roadmap with the new information in a timely way. We aim to update this roadmap after every major public release (such as 1.4.0) when the details for the next release are ready to share.

## Mission

Empower developers to create the richest & most engaging native apps & surfaces for the Windows ecosystem.

## Road to the next release

Our next WinAppSDK release will be version 1.5, expected to arrive in the first half of 2024 (24H1). 
In the last quarter of 2023 and going into the first half of 2024, the WinAppSDK's main goals are to become leaner and more efficient in our engineering processes and begin on an exciting new long-term journey towards supporting Cross-process Islands.

### Upcoming features for the Windows App SDK 1.5

Headline areas of work and features for the 1.5 timeframe include:

- **Windows App SDK** 
  - Upgrading our internal processes and infrastructure, allowing for more flexibility in shipping so we can speed up feature development and improve our undocked architecture
  - Improving support for the next Visual Studio and .NET MAUI
- **WinUI 3**
  - Getting started on a multi-release effort to support Cross-process Islands, including fundamental input and rendering support for Content Islands
  - Continuing to support File Explorer enhancements that we started in the 1.4 release
  - Adding controls to close the WinUI 2 to WinUI 3 gap for developers interested in porting their apps, including but not limited to the following:
    - Segmented control
    - Labels in the command bar flyout top bar items
    - Maps control
    - Investigations into the table view and ink controls
  - Supporting highly functional tabbed windows that work with touch, snapping, and other OS features
  - Drag and drop support in WebView2
  - Improved screen reader support, text scaling support, and other accessibility features
  - Fixes, documentation, and recommendations on how to test WinUI apps
  - Stability and performance improvements based on the prioritized GitHub bug backlog
- **Dynamic Lighting**
  - Onboarding new and exciting APIs to the Windows App SDK
