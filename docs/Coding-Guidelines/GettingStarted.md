# Getting Started

# Tooling Prerequisites

Development requires the following installed tools...

* Visual Studio 2019

# One-Time Setup

The `tools\DevCheck.cmd` command updates your development environment:

* Add test certificate to the certificate store. Used to sign test packages for inner-loop development and testing
* Install the TAEF servce (TE.Service). Used by TAEF to enable test functionality (e.g. RunAs).

# Tada!

Now you're ready to load `WindowsAppSDK.sln` and start development!
